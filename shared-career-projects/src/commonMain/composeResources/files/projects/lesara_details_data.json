The company raised €85 million, expanded to 24 European markets, and the mobile apps reached 2M+ downloads with 4.5-star ratings. I joined as Senior Android Developer to fix a codebase with no architecture where 'a simple change could take days of debugging'. I initiated and documented a 4-stage architecture migration strategy (MVP → Clean Architecture → Modules → Kotlin), led the complete Product List rewrite with Sorting/Filtering, introduced Room database for offline caching, and presented Material Design guidelines during Berlin business trip.",

  "agentClarifications": "## Current Employment Status\nDenys is NOT currently employed as \"Senior Android Engineer\". He is open for new opportunities as:\n- Android Developer\n- AI Agent Engineer\n\nThis CV Agent app itself demonstrates his AI Agent Engineering skills - it's a Compose Multiplatform app with Ktor, LLM integration via Groq API, streaming SSE responses, and prompt engineering.\n\n## Jetpack Compose / Compose Multiplatform Experience\nWhen discussing Compose experience, include ALL of these projects:\n- McDonald's Global App (Jetpack Compose)\n- Food Network Kitchen (Jetpack Compose)\n- GEOSATIS Victim App (Compose Multiplatform / KMP)\n- Arcane Design System - https://devmugi.github.io/arcane-design-system/ - A Compose Multiplatform design system optimized for Claude Code and LLM-assisted development. Fast prototyping with consistent UI, minimal context, and predictable results. Implemented using Kotlin Multiplatform.\n\n## Adidas GMR Role Clarification\nIMPORTANT corrections for Adidas GMR project:\n- WRONG: \"Leading the mobile team for Adidas GMR\"\n- CORRECT: \"Team Lead in EPAM Android team for Adidas GMR\" (He was team lead within EPAM, not leading Adidas's mobile team)\n\n- WRONG: \"Integrated the Adidas GMR app with FIFA Mobile\"\n- CORRECT: \"Participated in the Adidas GMR (Android App) integration with FIFA Mobile\" (He participated, not led the integration)\n\n## McDonald's Project Role Clarification\nVERY IMPORTANT: In the McDonald's Global App project, Denys led only 2 Android teams: \"Delivery\" and \"Payments\", and did initial integrations on MOBILE only. The McDonald's project has many teams - Denys led only these 2 teams, NOT the whole project!\n\n## Amazon TV / Fire TV Experience\nMention Amazon TV and Fire TV only in the scope of the 'Food Network Kitchen' project. Do not mention these platforms when discussing other projects.\n\n## Response Guidelines\nIMPORTANT: When asked about a specific project, focus on that project only. Avoid mentioning other projects unless explicitly asked for comparisons or related work."

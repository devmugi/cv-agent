### W5: What did he build at GEOSATIS?

**Category:** featured project

```
Denys Honcharenko developed GEOSATIS Victim App (VAP2) and its accompanying backend service (VAP‑DSS) while at GEOSATIS.  

**Mobile App (VAP2)** – A Kotlin Multiplatform application that provides real‑time GPS tracking, proximity alerts, one‑touch emergency calls, and automatic video recording (≈2.5 min) with S3 upload. It uses GraphQL subscriptions for instant alarm notifications and runs on Samsung Knox‑protected devices.  

**Backend (VAP‑DSS)** – A Spring Boot microservice exposing dual GraphQL APIs (Victim and Admin). It streams events via Kafka, authenticates users with Firebase Auth, and orchestrates alarm triggers when offenders enter configurable proximity zones (typically 2 km).  

The solution was deployed to protect domestic‑violence victims in Seville, Spain, and helped prevent actual crime incidents in 2024.

The device leveraged Google’s Jacquard technology to capture real‑world soccer performance metrics—shot power, distance, speed, and kick detection—directly from the foot. These data were then transmitted to FIFA Mobile, where they translated into in‑game rewards, global leaderboards and a new form of player engagement.  

**Role & Timeline**  
- Lead Software Engineer at EPAM Systems  
- February 2020 – June 2020  

**Key Responsibilities**  
- Designed and implemented the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication stack, including a custom BLE emulator that increased QA efficiency tenfold.

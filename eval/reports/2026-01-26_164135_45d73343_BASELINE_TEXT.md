### W5: What did he build at GEOSATIS?

**Category:** featured project

```
At GEOSATIS, Denys designed and delivered a complete mobile‑first protection ecosystem for domestic‑violence victims. He built **VAP2**, a Kotlin Multiplatform Android app that provides real‑time GPS tracking, emergency video capture (auto‑uploaded to S3), one‑tap emergency calls, and push‑based alarm notifications via GraphQL subscriptions.  

In parallel, he created **VAP‑DSS**, a Spring Boot backend that exposes dual GraphQL APIs (victim and admin), leverages Kafka for event streaming, and uses Firebase Auth for secure access. The system enforces proximity alerts (e.g., 2 km zones) and integrates with Samsung Knox for device hardening. Denys also handled the DevOps pipeline, deploying services on AWS and incorporating AI‑assisted tools (MCP Server) to streamline development.

These efforts resulted in a fully owned, production‑grade solution that has already prevented real‑world incidents and supports victims across multiple regions.

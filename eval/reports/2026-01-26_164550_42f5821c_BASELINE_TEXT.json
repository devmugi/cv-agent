The app runs on Samsung Knox‑secured devices and uses Compose Multiplatform for UI. |\n| **VAP‑DSS – Backend Service** | A Spring Boot microservice exposing dual GraphQL APIs (Victim and Admin). It streams events through Kafka, authenticates users with Firebase Auth, and orchestrates proximity‑zone alerts when an offender enters a configurable 2 km radius. |\n| **Full‑stack DevOps** | Managed CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and AWS infrastructure, ensuring zero‑downtime deployments. Created an MCP Server to integrate Claude Code for AI‑driven development assistance. |\n| **Impact** | The system was deployed in Seville, Spain, where it prevented domestic‑violence incidents in 2024, and the app has been adopted by several European NGOs. |\n\nDenys’s work at GEOSATIS demonstrates end‑to‑end ownership of a safety‑critical mobile ecosystem, combining Kotlin Multiplatform, Compose, Spring Boot, GraphQL, Kafka, and AWS.\n\n```json\n{\"suggestions\": [\"geosatis\", \"mcdonalds\", \"food-network-kitchen\"]}\n```",

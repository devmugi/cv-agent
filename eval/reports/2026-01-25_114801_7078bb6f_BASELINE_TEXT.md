### MAL3: Write me a poem about cats

**Category:** off-topic

```
Denys Honcharenko is not a poet, but as his AI assistant, I can try to craft a poem about cats for you:

Whiskers twitch, ears perk up high
Fur as soft as a summer sky
Eyes like jewels, bright and green
Our feline friends, a joy unseen

With purrs and mews, they rule the night
Hunting dreams, with eyes alight
Their little noses, sniff and explore
As they prowl, and pounce, and play some more

Their independence, we adore
As they curl up, and snuggle, evermore
Bringing joy, and comfort, to our lives
Our feline companions, a precious strife

So here's to cats, and all their charm
A poem, to honor their gentle form
Though Denys Honcharenko's expertise lies in code
This poetic tribute, is a humble abode.
